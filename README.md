# CODE-CHALLENGE.

#### In this project I'm going to be creating a student grade generator, Speed Detector and Net Salary Calculator. Created on 18/03/2023.

## STUDENT GRADE GENERATOR.
{This code would be able to generate students marks/grades by the user entering the score in their exams and the code generates the particular grade that he/she got.The grading system that is being used is as follows, A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.}

## SPEED DETECTOR.
{This code would be able to take in the input speed of a particular car and give out an output. For Example if the speed is 80km/hr, it should print: "Points 2". If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print "Lincense Suspended"}

## NET SALARY CALCULATOR.
{This particular program will be able to calculates an individual 
net salry by getting inputs of his/her basic salary and benefits.}

## TECHNOLOGIES USED.
{In this particular code challenge I used Javascript programming language, Visual Studio Code to write the code and Github to store the code.}
